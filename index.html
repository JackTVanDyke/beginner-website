        See what half of your tuition gets you! (The other half is given to
        sports teams and faculty members - yes we're a nonprofit organization.)
        Disclaimer: These facilities may have homeless people in them or requrie
        you to sign-up for a waitlist. We understand that you can't predict your
        week-to-week schedule due to work, class, and life, but that isn't our
        problem. You have to pay for these facilities to attend here whether or
        not you use them or CAN use them.

          <p>
            Our World Class Library features almost every book in existence. It
            also features several study spots that are always at full capacity,
            so get used to studying at home!

          <p>
            Our campuses feature some of the largest gyms in the world! Largest
            in facilities, and in wait times! Throughout the semester, half of
            available basketball and volleyball courts will be closed off. Why?
            We're not sure, and neither are you! Our gyms include free weights,
            machines, and plenty of squat racks. If you wait around long enough,
            you may even get to use one! Good luck finishing a full workout, let
            alone walking without being in anyone's personal space.

          <p>
            We know you're busy, so on our campuses, we have several cafeterias
            open 24/7. Don't go after 9PM though, as they're full of the local
            homeless population. We don't pay security enough to do anything
            about it. Our daily menu consists of the same exact burgers, hot
            dogs, pizza, and other boring breakfast/lunch options you got at
            high school! Exciting, right? They just cost a little bit more now -
            but no worries, your loans cover them! ðŸ˜Ž

              My parents said they'd pay for my tuition, but after failing my
              first semester because of my obsession with frat parties, they
              aren't helping me at all. Thankfully University of Long-term Debt
              is here to help me transition into one of the local homeless
              people. Thanks University!

              Majoring in Art History was one of the best decisions of my life.
              Now, after 5 years of study and 87k in student loans, I can pursue
              a Master's degree in hopes of being able to teach this to someone
              else some day. My manager at Starbucks also told me this could
              help me finally become assistant manager!
